    <h1>Rolando Islas | Web Development</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a front-end web developer mainly focused on creating apps with Vue and React.
      I also have experience in full-stack development with Ruby on Rails and Laravel as well as mobile development with React Native.
    </p>
    <p>
      This webpage is mainly focused on building my brand and hosting personal projects I create for learning.
      Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas or want to give advice on future projects.

    <p>
      Other things that I enjoy doing apart from programming are playing videogames and lately I've been learning how to play the piano.
